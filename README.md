# leobottaro.com
My personal website, complete with an about page, gallery, contact, test apps, and examples.

Feel free to copy and modify it anyway you want, just keep in mind that everything I do here is for me personaly, so don`t expect anything built for general use.

Every `app` available in my website are in a git sub-module, in separate repos, you won't find them here. To download them too, add the `--recursive` param to your clone command.


## Build Setup

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
