My personal website, complete with an about page, gallery, contact, test apps, and examples

Feel free to copy and modify it anyway you want, just keep in mind that everything I do here is for me personaly, so don`t expect anything special

Every `app` available in my website are in a git sub-module, in separate repos, you won't find them here. To download them too, add the `--recursive` param to your clone command
